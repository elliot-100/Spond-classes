    A Group has zero, one or more Subgroups.

    Attributes
    ----------
    uid : str
        id of the Group.
        'id' in API, but 'id' is a reserved term and the `spond` package uses `uid`.
    members : list[Member]
        Members belonging to the Group.
        Derived from 'members' in API, but returns Member instances instead of dicts.
    name : str
        Name of the Group.
        'name' in API.
    roles : list[Role]
        Roles belonging to the Group.
        Derived from 'roles' in API, but returns Role instances instead of dicts.
    subgroups : list[Subgroup]
        The Subgroups belonging to the Group.
        Derived from 'subgroups' in API, but returns Subgroup instances instead of dicts.
