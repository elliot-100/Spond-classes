# Introduction

[Spond](https://spond.com/welcome) is a team/group-oriented events system.

The unofficial Python [`spond`](https://github.com/Olen/Spond/) package gets data from
the Spond API and returns `dict` objects.

This unofficial Python [`spond-classes`](https://github.com/elliot-100/Spond-classes)
package parses those `dict`s to [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) class instances.

# Key classes

These are the classes intended for direct user instantiation:

- `Event` via `Event.from_dict()`
- `Group` via `Group.from_dict()`
"""

# Explicitly import classes and functions into the package namespace to define the API.

from .event import Event, EventType, Match, MatchInfo, MatchType, Responses
from .group import Group
from .member import Member
from .profile_ import Profile
from .role import Role
